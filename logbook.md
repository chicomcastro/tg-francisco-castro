# Logbook

This file describes what was done in each stage of development

## May 26, 2020

- Second meeting, research redirection and scope definition
- Started studing PR3C from references v0.1

## May 28, 2020

- Created virtual env based on [this tutorial][https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/]
- Installed required packages to start developing. They should be found in [requirements][./requirements].
- Reproduced example of numeric integration using ode lib from [here][https://ode-solver.readthedocs.io/en/master/double-pendulum-example.html]
- Made some charge test to evaluate spent time for different ode solvers, from scipy

## Jun 03, 2020

- Documented how to quickly activate venv
- Remove ./src/playground from .gitgnore to disponibilize initial python test with integrators and integrations
- Started reproducing results from [here][https://www.ime.usp.br/~fabcm/files/apresentacao_3corpos.pdf]

## Jun 05, 2020

- Initiated studying a more mathematical approach and dedution for physic modelling of (C)RTBP from [here][http://cosweb1.fau.edu/~jmirelesjames/hw4Notes.pdf]

## Jun 10, 2020

- Meeting with Ma√≠sa and Bertachini. We've decided to follow the patched conics approach initially to garantee optimized and fast results until we have a solid approach for numerical paching for our planned swing by through Venus

## Jun 11, 2020

- Trying implementing CRTBP on Python and Matlab. Have success in matlab, python needs some more improvements.
